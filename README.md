# COVID_Voter_death_data

This data was collected based on a question from [r/data](https://www.reddit.com/r/data/comments/phao3q/republicans_vs_covid/). 

According to the post, Republicans died from COVID-19 at 8x the rate at which Democrats died. The question was ask, how would that rate of death affect future elections.While I have reservations at the accuracy for the death rate, I assumed it to be true for the purposes of answering the question. I will use the 2020 Presidential election as a proxy for voter turnout in the future. 

I broke down results by state, to determine the effects on the Electoral College.

I gathered COVID-19 data from the [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Sex-and-Age/9bhg-hcku).
I gathered election data from [USelectionAtlas.org](https://uselectionatlas.org/).

According to the analysis attached, a death ratio of 8:1 for Republicans to Democrats would not have "flipped" any state from Donald Trump to Joe Biden in the 2020 Presidential election.
